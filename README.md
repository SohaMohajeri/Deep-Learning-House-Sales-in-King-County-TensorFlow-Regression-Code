House Price Predictions by Deep Learning with TensorFlow

In this Notebook, we will work on a dataset that contains house sale prices for King County in Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It is a great dataset for evaluating regression models.

The purpose of this Kernel is to develop a neural network that is capable of accurately predicting the house prices, given several measurements. For this purpose, first we will analyze this dataset and then build a deep learning regression model with without early stopping and droupout layers and evaluate the results. Finally, we will implement this model on a brand new data and predict the house prices.
